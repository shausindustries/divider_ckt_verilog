# divider_ckt_verilog
This project is currently in a development stage. This project has taken an unconventional route to implementing an already existing circuit for such purpose.
This project implements the use of comparators and subtractors, which is not efficient in terms of cost of development and power consumption, but just a simple implementation of an idea.
